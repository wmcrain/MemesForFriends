		Sit With Us is an Android social networking app that will allows to spontaneously meet new people at their current location. The purpose of this app is to make finding new people to develop temporary or long-lasting friendships with easier. The app will allow people to form spontaneous meetups and search for other nearby people and meetups to join using GPS.  </br>
		The final goal of the application is to have everything mentioned in this requirements document
functioning precisely as intended, with each feature being implemented in an efficient, easy-touse
way. We hope users will be able to use our application to form lasting friendships, by finding
users similar to themselves.
Our goals with the project are, in descending order of priority, having profiles implemented and
working with ability to view another profile, matching users with profiles, giving the user the
ability to manage their profile after creation, implementing meetups (both the meetup itself and
the ability to provide feedback as a result of the meetup), having a meetup history users can
view, implementing contact list integration, allowing a user to invite contacts to meetups,
implementing GPS integration to allow users to more easily find each other after matching,
implementing a block list, and finally, optimization. Optimization will ideally be performed
throughout the course of the application’s development, rather than at the end of the
development cycle.
One stretch goal is to have a working machine-learning based algorithm for matching users in a
more effective way than simply comparing similarity of tags. Since time is limited, it is likely
there will not be enough time to fully teach the algorithm, the goal is to have at the very least a
framework in place that learns behind the scenes and uses user feedback from matching to
train itself. The implementation of this goal is dependent on time and difficulty of the
implementation itself. Another is the implementation of sponsored locations, which are currently
on the roadmap but not a priority feature</br>
